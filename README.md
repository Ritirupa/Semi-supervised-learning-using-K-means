# Semi-supervised-learning-using-K-means
K-means clustering is usually used for unsupervised learning problems .For this assignment , we will use it as a pre-processing tool for semi-supervised learning.
If we only have a few labels, we can perform clustering and propagate the labels to all the instances (or to the closest instances decided by percentile) in the same cluster.
This technique can greatly increase the number of labels available for a subsequent supervised learning algorithm, and thus improve its performance.

The .ipynb notebook contains the code for the same.
